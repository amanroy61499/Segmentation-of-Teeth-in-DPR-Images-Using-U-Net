# Segmentation-of-Teeth-in-DPR-Images-Using-U-Net
Dental radiography is an important part of modern medicine, allowing the painless assessment and treatment of a wide variety of conditions. 

The goal is to is to develop an accurate computerized system that will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of dental image evaluation, diagnosis and harness the power of deep learning and computer vision techniques to develop a solution that can reliably detect, segment, and assign tooth numbers in panoramic dental images. This effort primarily addresses the challenges associated with manual dental assessments, which are time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. 

By using the U- Net architecture, which has shown promising results in image segmentation tasks, our goal is to train a model that can accurately distinguish between tooth boundaries and contours, enabling accurate tooth segmentation.
